# review_summarizer_project
Building a review summariser which gives the important points hilighted from a given text
Few of the tech stacks i will be using are:
*PyTorch → Deep learning framework (flexible, great for custom models).

*HuggingFace Transformers → Pretrained NLP models (like BERT).

*Pandas, NumPy → Data handling.

*Matplotlib/Seaborn → Visualization.

*Flask/FastAPI → API for your model.

*MongoDB / Firebase → Store user input/output.

*Streamlit → Simple frontend interface.

I just wanted to build it. No big ideas on how to improve it further, but i'll edit this on the go.
